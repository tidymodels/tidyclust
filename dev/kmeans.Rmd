```{r, include = FALSE}

## Fit

```{r}
kmeans_spec <- k_means(k = 5) |>
  set_engine("stats")

penguins_rec_1 <- recipe(~ ., data = penguins) |>
  update_role(species, island, new_role = "demographic") |>
  step_dummy(sex)
  
  
penguins_rec_2 <- recipe(species ~ ., data = penguins) |>
  step_dummy(sex, island)

wflow_1 <- workflow() |>
  add_model(kmeans_spec) |>
  add_recipe(penguins_rec_1)


wflow_2 <- workflow() |>
  add_model(kmeans_spec) |>
  add_recipe(penguins_rec_2)
```

We need workflows!

```{r}
# dropping NA first so rows match up later, this is clunky
pen_sub <- penguins |> 
  drop_na() |>
  select(-species, -island, -sex)

kmeans_fit <- kmeans_spec |> fit( ~., pen_sub)

kmeans_fit |>
  predict(new_data = pen_sub)

### try my new version
kmeans_fit |>
  extract_cluster_assignment()
```

* Needed flexclust install; probably not necessary, we could implement for kmeans with just dists

* Missing values should probably return an NA prediction.  Or for k-means, imputation isn't crazy...

* We want a consistent return, and k-means is randomized.  We should agree to a consistent default ordering throughout tidyclust - maybe by size (number of members) or something?


```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(
    preds = predict(kmeans_fit, new_data = pen_sub)$.pred_cluster
  ) |>
  count(preds, sex, species)
```

## Diagnostics

* Measure cluster enrichment with demographic variables (an official recipe designation?).  Include Chi-Square or ANOVA tests???

* Exploit confusion matrix from `yardstick`

* Characterization of clusters, presumably by centers?

* Automatic plot?!


## talk to Emil

* Ordering of clusters is really bothering me
something with indices

* Cluster density followup: is it kind of a model?

```{r}
recipe( ~ demo1 + predictor1) |>
  step_tidyclust(kmeans_fit) # doesn't quite make sense
  
```

* Some of these followups feel like they need a recipe.  Which vars are we using for within SS?  Which vars for enrichments? Do we PCA first?  etc.

```{r}
get_SS(Cluster ~ v1 + v2)
recipe(Cluster ~ v1 + v2) |>
  step_pca() |>
  get_ss()
```

... or maybe fit `enrichment()` on a recipe and it automatically uses the variables with the "enrich" role?  
how would PCA fit in on this?

How does `fit()` access the right variables?

... is this even worth it given we can attach cluster assignments?  I say yes, because what if we are trying to "cross-validate".


```{r}
penguins_2 <- penguins |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(
    preds = predict(kmeans_fit, new_data = pen_sub)$.pred_cluster
  ) 

debugonce(enrichment)
penguins_2 |>
  enrichment(preds, species)
```
